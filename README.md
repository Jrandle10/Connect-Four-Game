# Four The Kerr Way!


# Game Overview:

Four The Kerr Way! is a remake of the classic game Connect Four with a Steve Kerr theme. Steve Kerr won four NBA championships in a row! Three with the great Chicago Bulls ('96, '97, '98), and one with the San Antonio Spurs ('98)!
He is one of the only players to accomplish this feat (Michael Jordan didn't even do that). In memory of that great run, the black and red color in the game represent the Chicago Bulls. The Black and Grey tokens represent the San Antonio Spurs.

# How to play

The rules are the same as the classic game Connect Four, but if this is your first time playing I got you covered!


  1. It takes two to tango! This is a two player game. Each player will decide to be either Home or Away.
  2. Home will always go first
  3. Each player will take turns choosing a column to drop their token in.
      i. The token will fall to the bottom of the game board and occupy the lowest empty cell.
  4. To win you have to match four of your tokens in a row.
  5. The first player to match vertically, horizontally, or diagonal WINS the game!
